<h1>My About-Me Project, Jan Palma</h1>

<h2>Description of Project</h2>
In this project, I created a portfolio about myself, Jan Palma including goals that I wish to achieve, goals that I have already achieved, and a self evaluated description on what I believe are my capabilities. Within my goals, I also explain a short story of the skills I believe are most important in coding, while collaborating with others. Finally, I added a natural picture of myself on the right side of the screen.

## Code

Within the CSS code that I used for my project, and I used Inline styling to change the font sizes and font family, along with also using inline styling to position my image. Additionally, inside the body of my website, I wrote all my div classes, including the boxes that were used for each part of my about me that describes myself.
